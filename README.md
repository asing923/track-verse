# Track Verse Features:
The Track Verse project aims to design and implement a ReST API for accessing artists, albums, tracks, and genres from the Free Music Archive (FMA). Additionally, it includes the functionality to create custom lists of tracks. A client interface using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is developed to interact with the API. Asynchronous operations are utilized to display both static and dynamic data. The project employs a single web server/network endpoint to serve both the web application and ReST API. Input sanitization techniques are applied to ensure data security. The project utilizes Node.js and Express to create the ReST API.
